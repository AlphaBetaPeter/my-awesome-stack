# My awesome stack
This project is a playground/template for a modern tech stack.

The major goal is to make use of modern technologies and frameworks while understanding how they can be used in environments from local development to cloud deployment.

This includes the application itself (database, api, web) as well as tools and concepts around it. Since there is no defined end to this project here are some ideas that could be incorporated into it:

* Everything is a container
* Easy local development
* Easy cloud deployment (docker swarm / kubernetes)
* Resiliency
* Monitoring
* Logging
* Microservice messaging
* Application security
